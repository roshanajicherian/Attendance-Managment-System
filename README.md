# Attendance-Managment-System

In the present scenario, accurate and timely attendance recording has become very important, mainly since the current grading systems in various educational institutes include attendance as a parameter. Hence in order to avoid any overlooked errors in recording, students must be able to view the status of their attendance at any given instant; at the same time giving teachers and/or the administrator the authorization control. Most attendance systems in institutions are not maintained properly or are not very user-friendly. **SPARK (Students Progressive Attendance Record Keeper)** makes it easy to view information for both teachers and students alike. The organized user interface of **SPARK** enables teachers and students to access authorized information very quickly making it less frustrating. The unsophisticated design of the system helps in smooth maintenance. The proposed system is also virtually flawless in terms of recording attendance as the teachers and administrators are the final authority and they have the ultimate control, increasing the reliability of the system. SPARK provides information such as attendance percentage, number of days absent, and number of classes a student must attend to obtain a minimum attendance percentage. A **messaging system** will allow parents to receive messages on their phones when the attendance percentage of their ward drops below the required minimum.
